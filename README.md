[TwentyOne/Blackjack Project](General/TwentyOne)

### TwentyOne/Blackjack Project
This is a fully functional console application that allows the user to play a game of blackjack. It allows the user to specify the (fictional) amount of money they are bringing to the game, and then proceed to play. All the standard blackjack functionality is present, such as allowing the player to hit or stay, and blackjack being an automatic win for who gets it. There is also custom logic to ensure the dealer must hit if their card total is below a certain number, and must stay if it's above (similar to how the game is usually played). The player is allowed to specify how much money they bet before each hand, and this total will actually flucuate in real-time depending on if the player wins or loses. This is to prevent the player from betting more money then they have.
